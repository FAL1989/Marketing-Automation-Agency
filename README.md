# AI Agency

## Overview
AI Agency is a powerful platform that leverages multiple specialized AI agents to assist in software development tasks. The system provides comprehensive project support through requirements analysis, code review, architecture design, and security assessment capabilities, all integrated into a user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Multi-Agent System
- **RequirementsAnalyzer**: Analyzes project requirements, identifies dependencies, and validates specifications
- **CodeAnalyzer**: Reviews code quality, suggests improvements, and checks for best practices
- **ArchitectureDesigner**: Designs system architecture, evaluates patterns, and provides optimization recommendations
- **SecurityAnalyzer**: Performs security assessments, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes remediation steps

### Interactive Dashboard
- Real-time agent status monitoring
- Timeline-based interaction history
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Collaborative agent workspace
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
